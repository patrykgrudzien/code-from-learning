A manifestation of the manifest

--------- Description ---------
"package-lock.json" is automatically generated for any operations where NPM modifies either the "node_modules" tree, or
"package.json". It describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical
trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
