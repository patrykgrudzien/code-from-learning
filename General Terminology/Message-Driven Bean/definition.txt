A "MESSAGE-DRIVEN BEAN" is an enterprise bean that allows Java EE applications to process messages asynchronously. It normally
acts as a JMS message listener, which is similar to an event listener except that it receives JMS messages instead of events.
The messages can be sent by any Java EE component (an application client, another enterprise bean, or a web component) or by a
JMS application or system that does not use Java EE technology. Message-driven beans can process JMS messages or other kind of
messages.
