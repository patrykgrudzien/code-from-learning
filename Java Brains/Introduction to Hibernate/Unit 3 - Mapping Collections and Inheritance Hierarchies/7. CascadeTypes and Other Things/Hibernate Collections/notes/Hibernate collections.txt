Hibernate has its own internal DATA TYPES that it maps to for collecion objects.
There are a couple of semantics (listed in the screenshot attached in "screenshots" folder).

1) Bag semantic - List / ArrayList
Bag - it doesn't matter how we put things inside. We can put/retrieve in any order.

2) Bag semantic with ID - List / ArrayList
As previous we can use that kind of DATA TYPE by using List or ArrayList in Java.
Both List and ArrayList has INDEX property.

3) List semantic - List / ArrayList
The only difference here is that (LIST) CAN BE ORDERED. We can have sorted list but bag doesn't matter of order.

4) Set semantic - Set

5) Map semantic - Map
