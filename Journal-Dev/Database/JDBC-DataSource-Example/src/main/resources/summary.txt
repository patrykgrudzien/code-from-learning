If you look at the JDBC DataSource and it's usage, it can be done with normal DriverManager too. The major benefit of Java
DataSource is when it's used within a CONTEXT and with JNDI.

With simple configurations we can create a DATABASE CONNECTION POOL that is maintained by the CONTAINER itself. Most of the
servlet containers such as TOMCAT and JBOSS provide it's own JAVA DATASOURCE implementation and all we need is to configure it
through simple XML based configurations and then use JNDI context lookup to get the Java DataSource and work with it. This
helps us by taking care of connection pooling and management from our application side to server side and thus giving us more
time to write business logic for the application.
