Java 8 Date Time API consists of following packages.

1) java.time Package: This is the base package of new Java Date Time API. All the major base classes are part of this
package, such as LocalDate, LocalTime, LocalDateTime, Instant, Period, Duration etc. All of these classes are
immutable and thread safe. Most of the times, these classes will be sufficient for handling common requirements.

2) java.time.chrono Package: This package defines generic APIs for non ISO calendar systems. We can extend
AbstractChronology class to create our own calendar system.

3) java.time.format Package: This package contains classes used for formatting and parsing date time objects.
Most of the times, we would not be directly using them because principle classes in java.time package
provide formatting and parsing methods.

4) java.time.temporal Package: This package contains temporal objects and we can use it for find out specific date or
time related to date/time object. For example, we can use these to find out the first or last day of the month.
You can identify these methods easily because they always have format “withXXX”.

5) java.time.zone Package: This package contains classes for supporting different time zones and their rules.
