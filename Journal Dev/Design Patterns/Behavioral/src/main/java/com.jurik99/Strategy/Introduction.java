	/*
	 * Strategy design pattern is one of the "behavioral design pattern".
	 * Strategy pattern is used when we have multiple algorithm for a specific task and client decides the actual
	 * implementation to be used at runtime.
	 *
	 * One of the best example of strategy pattern is "Collections.sort()" method that takes "Comparator" parameter.
	 * Based on the different implementations of Comparator interfaces, the Objects are getting sorted in different
	 * ways.
	 *
	 * For our example, we will try to implement a simple Shopping Card where we have two payment strategies -
	 * using "Credit Card" or using "PayPal".
