     * (KIND) -> CREATIONAL DESIGN PATTERN
     *
     * Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple sub-classes and based on input, we need to
     * return one of the sub-class. This pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client program to
     * the factory class. We can apply Singleton pattern on Factory class or make the factory method static.
