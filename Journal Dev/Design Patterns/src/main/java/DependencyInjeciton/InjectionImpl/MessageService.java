     * 1) Service components should be designed with base class or interface. Itâ€™s better to prefer interfaces or abstract classes
     * that would define contract for the services.
     * <p>
     * 2) Consumer classes should be written in terms of serviceImpl interface.
     * <p>
     * 3) Injector classes that will initialize the services and then the consumer classes.
