"Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes
the subsystem easier to use".

Suppose we have an application with set of interfaces to use MySql/Oracle database and to generate different types of reports,
such as HTML report, PDF report etc.

So we will have different set of interfaces to work with different types of database. Now a client application can use these
interfaces to get the required database connection and generate reports.

But when the complexity increases or the interface behavior names are confusing, client application will find it difficult to
manage it.

So we can apply Facade design pattern here and provide a wrapper interface on top of the existing interface to help client
application.
