	 *  Adapter design pattern is one of the STRUCTURAL DESIGN PATTERN and its used so that two unrelated interfaces
	 *  can work together. The object that joins these unrelated interface is called an ADAPTER.
	 *
	 *  One of the great real life example of Adapter pattern is mobile charger. Mobile baterry needs 3 volts to
	 *  charge but the normal socket produces either 120V (US) or 240V (India). So the mobile charger works as an
	 *  adapter between mobile charging socket and the wall socket.
	 *
	 *  Step-by-step:
	 *  1) 2 classes - Volt, Socket
	 *  2) SocketAdapter interface
	 *  3) SocketClassAdapterImpl
	 *  4) SocketObjectAdapterImpl
	 *  5) AdapterPatternTest
