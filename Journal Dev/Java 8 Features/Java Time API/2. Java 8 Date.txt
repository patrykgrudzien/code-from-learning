Java 8 Date Time API is "JSR-310" implementation. It is designed to overcome all the flaws in the legacy date time
implementations. Some of the design principles of new Date Time API are:

1) IMMUTABILITY: all the classes in the new Date Time API are immutable and good for multithreaded environments.

2) SEPARATION OF CONCERNS: The new API separates clearly between human readable date time and machine time (unix
timestamp). It defines separate classes for Date, Time, DateTime, Timestamp, Timezone etc.

3) CLARITY: The methods are clearly defined and perform the same action in all the classes. For example, to get the
current instance we have now() method. There are format() and parse() methods defined in all these classes rather than
having a separate class for them. All the classes use Factory Pattern and Strategy Pattern for better handling.
Once you have used the methods in one of the class, working with other classes wonâ€™t be hard.

4) UTILITY OPERATIONS: All the new Date Time API classes comes with methods to perform common tasks, such as plus,
minus, format, parsing, getting separate part in date/time etc.

5) EXTENDABLE: The new Date Time API works on ISO-8601 calendar system but we can use it with other non ISO
calendars as well.
