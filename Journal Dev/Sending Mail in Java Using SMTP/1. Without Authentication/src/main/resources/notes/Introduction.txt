Java Program to send email contains following steps:
1) Creating (javax.mail.Session) object
2) Creating (javax.mail.internet.MimeMessage) object. We have to set different properties in this object such as
recipient email address, Email Subject, Reply-To email, email body, attachments etc.
3) Using (javax.mail.Transport) to send the email message.

The logic to create session differs based on the type of SMTP server, for example if SMTP server doesn't require any
authentication we can create the Session object with some simple properties whereas if it requires TLS od SSL
authentication, then logic to create will differ.

So we will create a utility class with some methods to send emails and then we will use this utility method with
different SMTP servers.
