     * Since Java 8, we can define one- and two-parameter functions in Java,
     * allowing us to inject their behaviors into other functions, by passing them in as parameters.
     * But for functions with more parameters, we rely on external libraries like Vavr.
     *
     * Another option is to use currying. By combining currying and functional interfaces,
     * we can even define easy-to-read builders that force the user to provide all inputs.
