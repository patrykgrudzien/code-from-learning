/**
 * The adapter pattern describes how to convert an object into another object which a clients expects.
 * This pattern mainly adapts one object to another one.
 * Adapters allow objects to work together that couldnâ€™t otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
 *
 * Adapter allows to reuse existing coding without changing it, as the adapter ensures the conversion between the different interfaces.
 *
 * In comparison to a decorator pattern, the adapter pattern only converts objects, while the decorator pattern adds new functionality to an existing object.
 * Therefore, the decorator does not change the existing interface.
