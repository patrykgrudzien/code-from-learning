/**
 * Wikipedia defines Chain of Responsibility as a design pattern consisting of “a source of command objects and a series of processing objects”.
 *
 * Each processing object in the chain is responsible for a certain type of command, and the processing is done,
 * it forwards the command to the next processor in the chain.
 *
 * The Chain of Responsibility pattern is handy for:
 *
 * 1) Decoupling a sender and receiver of a command
 * 2) Picking a processing strategy at processing-time
