/**
 * The command pattern is a behavioral design pattern and is part of the GoF‘s formal list of design patterns.
 * Simply put, the pattern intends to encapsulate in an object all the data required for
 * performing a given action (command), including what method to call, the method’s arguments,
 * and the object to which the method belongs.
 *
 * This model allows us to decouple objects that produce the commands from their consumers,
 * so that’s why the pattern is commonly known as the producer-consumer pattern.
 *
 * In this tutorial, we’ll learn how to implement the command pattern in Java by using both
 * - (object-oriented)
 * and
 * - (object-functional)
 * approaches, and we’ll see in what use cases it can be useful.
