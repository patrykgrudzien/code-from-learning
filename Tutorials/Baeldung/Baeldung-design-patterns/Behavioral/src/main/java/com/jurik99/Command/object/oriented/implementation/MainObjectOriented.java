/**
 * In a classic implementation, the command pattern requires implementing four components:
 * the Command, the Receiver, the Invoker, and the Client.
 *
 * To understand how the pattern works and the role that each component plays, let’s create a basic example.
 *
 * Let’s suppose that we want to develop a text file application.
 * In such a case, we should implement all functionality required for performing some text-file related operations,
 * such as opening, writing, saving a text file, and so forth.
 *
 * So, we should break down the application into the four components mentioned above.
