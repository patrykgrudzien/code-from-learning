Database Instance - it is very important that we distinguish these two terms individually. Database schema is the
skeleton of database. It is designed when the database does NOT exists at all. Once the database is operational, it
is very difficult to make any changes to it. A database schema does NOT contain any data or information.

DATABASE INSTANCE - is a state of operational database with data at any given time. It contains a snapshot of the
database. Database instances tend to change with time. A DBMS ensures that its every instance (state) is in valid
state, by diligently following all the validations, constraints, and conditions that the database designers have
imposed (nakładać, narzucać, dyktować).
