A database schema is the skeleton structure that represents the logical view of the entire database. It defines how
the data is organized and how the relations among them are associated. It formulates all the constraints that are to
be applied on the data.

A database schema defines its entities and the relationship amond them. It contains a descriptive detail of the
database, which can be depicted by means of schema diagrams. It's the database designers who design the schema to
help programmers understand database and make it useful.

A database schema can be divided broadly into two categories:
1) PHYSICAL DATABASE SCHEMA - this schema pertains (odnosi siÄ™ do) to the actual storage of data and its form of
storage like files, indices, etc. It defines how the data will be stored in a secondary storage.
2) LOGICAL DATABASE SCHEMA - this schema defines all the logical constraints that need to be applied on the data
stored. It defines tables, views, and integrity constraints.
