Constraints are the rules enforced on the data columns of a table. These are used to limit the type of data that
can go into a table. This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the database.

Constraints could be either on a column level or a table level. The column level constraints are applied only to
one column, whereas the table level constraints are applied to the whole table.

Following are some of the most commonly used constraints available in SQL. These constraints have already been
discussed in SQL - RDBMS Concepts chapter, but it’s worth to revise them at this point.

1) NOT NULL Constraint − Ensures that a column cannot have NULL value.

2) DEFAULT Constraint − Provides a default value for a column when none is specified.

3) UNIQUE Constraint − Ensures that all values in a column are different.

4) PRIMARY Key − Uniquely identifies each row/record in a database table.

5) FOREIGN Key − Uniquely identifies a row/record in any of the given database table.

6) CHECK Constraint − The CHECK constraint ensures that all the values in a column satisfies certain conditions.

7) INDEX − Used to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly.

Constraints can be specified when a table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement or you can use the
ALTER TABLE statement to create constraints even after the table is created.
