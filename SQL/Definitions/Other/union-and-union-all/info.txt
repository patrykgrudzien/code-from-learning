UNION removes duplicate records (where all columns in the results are the same), UNION ALL does NOT !!!

There is a performance hit when using UNION vs UNION ALL, since the database server must do additional work to
remove the duplicate rows, but usually you do not want the duplicates (especially when developing reports).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Both UNION and UNION ALL concatenate the result of two different SQLs. They differ in the way they handle duplicates.

*) UNION performs a DISTINCT on the result set, eliminating any duplicate rows.
*) UNION ALL does not remove duplicates, and it therefore faster than UNION.
