ONLINE is an Oracle statement which defines if DML (Data Manipulation Language) should be allowed during index
build/rebuild.

-- CREATING AN INDEX ONLINE --
You can create and rebuild indexes online. This enables you to update base tables at the same time you are building
or rebuilding indexes on that table. You can perform DML operations while the index build is taking place, but DDL
(Data Definition Language) operations are not allowed. Parallel execution is not supported when creating or
rebuilding an index online.
