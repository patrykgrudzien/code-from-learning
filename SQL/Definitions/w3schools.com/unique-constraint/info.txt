The UNIQUE constraint ensures that all values in a column are different.
Both the UNIQUE and PRIMARY KEY constraints provide a guarantee for uniqueness for a column or set of columns.

A PRIMARY KEY constraint automatically has a UNIQUE constraint.
However, you can have many UNIQUE constraints per table, BUT ONLY ONE PRIMARY KEY constraint per table !!!

UNIQUE -> allows "nulls"
PRIMARY KEY -> NOT allow "nulls"
