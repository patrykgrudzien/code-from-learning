-- STACKOVERFLOW --
The "discriminator-value" is used to determine the class type of the entity subclass type associated with a given
database row entry in the base class database table.

-- CODERANCH --
You use a discriminator to flag to Hibernate which type of object a particular row in your table represents. It is
there to support one table being used to represent an entire class hierarchy (the table per class hierarchy pattern).

-- SIMPLE EXAMPLE --
You have a table called "phone_numbers" BUT "home", "office" and "cell phone" numbers all could go in that one table.

So "phone_numbers" table is:
- id
- phone_number
- phone_type

id      phone_number        phone_type
1       123-555-888         home
2       123-555-888         cell
3       123-555-888         office

In Java you have a class hierarchy of:
- you have a "Phone" abstract class with two attributes "id" and "phoneNumber"
- you have 3 subclasses: "Home", "Cell", "Office"

Now how does Hibernate know which type of subclass to create, well it uses the DISCRIMINATOR COLUMN "phone_type"
