Let's now demonstrate the 'version control' functionality of liquibase.
Suppose at beginning we have a clean database with nothing in it. The database change log has 3 versions:
* 1.0
* 1.1
* 1.2
defined in previous files.

* version 1.0 -> create 2 tables
* version 1.1 -> change column name of table department
* version 1.2 -> add foreign key and index
