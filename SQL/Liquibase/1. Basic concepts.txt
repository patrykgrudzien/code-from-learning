ChangeSet is a logic group in which you can put any real operation. For example, a change set can has operations to
create a table, rename a column, add foreign key or any other database operations.

How does liquibase identify a change set?
Change set is identified by 3 elements:
1) ID
2) Author
3) Change log filename (with path)

When run liquibase first time, it will create 2 extra tables in your database:
1) databasechangelog
2) databasechangeloglock

Liquibase will go through changelog xml file, see if there are some change sets not in this table. If found, execute
them and put a record in this table. By using this table, liquibase can trace which changeset has already executed,
which changeset is new. Tags can be used to specify a version you want to go. To use liquibase, you don't need to
touch this "databasechangelog" table, but it can help you understand how liquibase works.

To use liquibase, you also need a change log file, in which all database operations are defined.
