Liquibase is a database change management tool. Rather than writing SQL directly against the database to
create, update or drop database objects, developers define their desired database changes in XML files.

Any change to database are grouped into "ChangeSet", the best practice is one changeset per modification
to make roll back easily. Changes to database can be taged, e.g. you can tag your database structure to 1.0
after first release. Later, when some patches are made and ver. 1.1 is release, you can tag all changes
up to now to 1.1. (If it's not very clear now, it's ok, see the examples below will make it more obvious).
With the help of those tags, you can easily rollback your database structure to a certain version. (Also
liquibase can rollback without tags.)

One notion need to be clarified first, liquibase ONLY MANAGE SCHEMA CHANGES OF YOUR DATABASE, e.g. add extra
index or rename a column, THE DATA IN THE TABLES ARE NOT MANAGED !!!
