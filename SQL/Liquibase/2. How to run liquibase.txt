Before the demo starts, let's first see how to run liquibase. In this tutorial, 2 ways are introduced:
1) By command line
2) By maven plugin

Tu run liquibase in command line, you need:
* download liquibase, unpack it executable file "liquibase" or "liquibase.bat" in the package
* download your database jdbc driver to your local disk

To run liquibase by using maven, you need:
* change pom file, add "liquibase-maven-plugin"

Since in pom.xml the jdbc driver dependency has already been added, you don't need the external jdbc .jar file.
You can choose either command line or maven plugin to run liquibase. I personally prefer by maven plugin, cause the
command can be much shorter.
